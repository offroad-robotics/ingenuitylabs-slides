# Presentation Slides LaTeX Class and Template for Ingenuity Labs

The [Ingenuity Labs Research Institute](https://ingenuitylabs.queensu.ca) is an interdisciplinary initiative at [Queenâ€™s University](http://www.queensu.ca) focused on combining artificial intelligence, robotics, and human machine interaction to create future intelligent systems and robotic machines that enhance human productivity, safety, performance, and quality of life.

This template provides a simple and clean [LaTeX Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) class for Ingenuity Labs researchers that emulates most of the standard Ingenuity Labs Powerpoint template.  

LaTeX templates are particularly useful for technical presentations involving maths and code snippets.  Video is currently not supported.

## Example Output

See the example [PDF output](ingenuitylabs-slides-example.pdf) included in this repository.
